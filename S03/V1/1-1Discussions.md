### **Key Points of the session and expected LOs Discussed**
Session 3:
- Continue with express making basic crud operations in server.js using db.json
  - *Pain Point: NEM3O5 students are seeing the implementation of HOFs for first time, they feel tough to understand core business logic (crud using db.json) and express terminologies*
  - *Pain Point: many students will get confuse between res.json() and res.send(), which one to use and when to use*
- Explaining API parts req.body, req.query, etc
- Then introducing need for file,code, folder seggregation, for clean, neat and effective coding
- Then introducing express.Router, cutting pasting same code into another file under Router
*Pain Point: NEM305 students will not feel/visualize, how server.js is executing code written in routes file/folder*
- CRUD opeartions using query/params (Need to decide, No according to Venu), 


### **Observations after Notion Doc is Ready:**
