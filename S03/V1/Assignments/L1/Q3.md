## **L1. The Story of The Book Haven**  

In a quiet town, there was a small bookstore called **The Book Haven**. It wasn't just any bookstoreâ€”it was a place where stories found a home, where people could discover hidden gems, and where every book had a story to tell beyond its pages.  

However, the owner, **Mr. Bennett**, struggled with keeping track of all the books in his store. His old paper-based system was failing himâ€”books were misplaced, customer requests were lost, and finding a book by a specific author took ages.  

One evening, frustrated with the mess, Mr. Bennett reached out to you, a skilled **Node.js** developer. "I need your help!" he said. "I want a simple system where I can store and manage my book collection without losing track of anything."  

### **The Challenge**  

Mr. Bennett wants you to build a **Book Storage API** using **Express.js**. He has just a few requirements:  

1. **A way to store book details**  
   - Since he isnâ€™t tech-savvy, he wants something simpleâ€”so you decide to use a plain **db.json** file to store all book records.  

2. **Basic operations to manage books**  
   - He should be able to **add** new books, **view all books**, and **search for a book by ID**.  
   - If a book needs an update (maybe the title was misspelled), he should be able to **update** it.  
   - And of course, if a book is no longer in the store, he should be able to **remove** it.  

3. **A smarter way to search**  
   - Sometimes, customers come in and ask, "Do you have books by Paulo Coelho?" Instead of flipping through papers, Mr. Bennett wants to be able to search books by **author name**.  
   - But what if the customer only remembers part of the authorâ€™s name? You decide to make the search **intelligent**, allowing partial name matches.  
   - Additionally, some customers might only remember the **title** of a book, so searching by title should also be possible.  

4. **A friendly way to handle mistakes**  
   - If a customer asks for a book that doesnâ€™t exist, Mr. Bennett should get a message saying **"No books found."**  
   - If someone tries to visit a random, undefined route, they should see a **404 Not Found** message.  

### **Your Mission**  

Your task is to build an **Express.js API** that can handle all these needs. Mr. Bennett is excited to test it, so make sure:  

- The server starts without errors.  
- Every API works as expected.  
- It responds with proper status codes.  
- The code is **clean and well-structured**.  
- You provide clear instructions in a **README** file so Mr. Bennett (or anyone else) can easily set it up.  

Once your **Book Storage API** is complete, submit it to a **Masai GitHub repository** and share the link. Mr. Bennett is counting on youâ€”**letâ€™s make The Book Haven smarter!** ðŸš€
