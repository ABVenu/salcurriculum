### **L1: Simple Dishes API**  

#### **Objective:**  
Create an **Express.js** application that performs **CRUD operations** on a collection of dishes using `db.json` as a database.  

#### **Problem Statement:**  

1. Initialize a new **Node.js** project and install **Express.js**.  
2. Use `db.json` to store dish data.  
3. Create a file named **server.js** and set up an Express server.  
4. Implement the following **CRUD operations** for dishes directly inside `server.js`:  
   - `POST /dishes` → Add a new dish.  
   - `GET /dishes` → Retrieve all dishes.  
   - `GET /dishes/:id` → Retrieve a dish by its **ID**.  
   - `PUT /dishes/:id` → Update a dish by its **ID**.  
   - `DELETE /dishes/:id` → Delete a dish by its **ID**.  
5. Implement an **extra GET request**:  
   - `GET /dishes/get?name=<dish_name>` → Search for dishes by **name**.  
   - If a dish with the given name exists, return all matching dishes.  
   - If no dish is found, respond with **"No dishes found"**.  
6. **Bonus Feature:**  
   - The **search by name** API should also return results for **partial name matches**.  
7. Handle any **undefined routes** with a `404 Not Found` message.  
8. Start the server and test all routes using **Postman** or a web browser.  

#### **Expected Output Examples:**  

- `POST /dishes` (Adding a new dish)  
  ```json
  { "id": 1, "name": "Idly", "price": 50, "category": "Breakfast" }
  ```  

- `GET /dishes/get?name=idly` (Searching for dishes by name)  
  ```json
  [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Idly", "price": 50, "category": "Breakfast" },
    { "id": 5, "name": "Idly Fry", "price": 70, "category": "Breakfast" }
  ]
  ```  

- `GET /dishes/get?name=dosa` (If no matching dish found)  
  ```json
  { "message": "No dishes found" }
  ```  

- Visiting any undefined route should return:  
  ```json
  { "error": "404 Not Found" }
  ```  

### **Other Instructions**  
- Send appropriate **HTTP status codes** along with responses.  
- Maintain **clean coding practices**.  
- Handle **errors properly**.  

### **Submission Guidelines**  
- Submit a **Masai GitHub repository** after completing the code.  
- Provide a **README** with setup instructions.
