### **L1: Simple Booking Storage API**  

#### **Objective:**  
Build an **Express.js** application to manage a collection of books using `db.json` as a database.  

#### **Problem Statement:**  

1. Initialize a new **Node.js** project and install **Express.js**.  
2. Use `db.json` to store book data.  
3. Create a file named **server.js** and set up an Express server.  
4. Implement the following **CRUD operations** for books directly inside `server.js`:  
   - `POST /books` → Add a new book.  
   - `GET /books` → Retrieve all books.  
   - `GET /books/:id` → Retrieve a book by its **ID**.  
   - `PUT /books/:id` → Update a book by its **ID**.  
   - `DELETE /books/:id` → Delete a book by its **ID**.  
5. Implement an **extra GET request**:  
   - `GET /books/search?author=<author_name>` → Search for books by **author name**.  
   - If books by the given author exist, return all matching books.  
   - If no books are found, respond with **"No books found"**.  
6. **Bonus Feature:**  
   - The **search by author** API should also return results for **partial author name matches**.  
   - Add another query to **search by title**.  
7. Handle any **undefined routes** with a `404 Not Found` message.  
8. Start the server and test all routes using **Postman** or a web browser.  

#### **Expected Output Examples:**  

- `POST /books` (Adding a new book)  
  ```json
  { "id": 1, "title": "The Alchemist", "author": "Paulo Coelho", "year": 1988 }
  ```  

- `GET /books/search?author=paulo` (Searching for books by author)  
  ```json
  [
    { "id": 1, "title": "The Alchemist", "author": "Paulo Coelho", "year": 1988 },
    { "id": 3, "title": "Brida", "author": "Paulo Coelho", "year": 1990 }
  ]
  ```  

- `GET /books/search?author=rowling` (If no matching books found)  
  ```json
  { "message": "No books found" }
  ```  

- Visiting any undefined route should return:  
  ```json
  { "error": "404 Not Found" }
  ```
