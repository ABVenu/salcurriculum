### L1: User Authentication and Password Reset System

**Objective:**
Design and implement a secure backend system that handles user registration, authentication, and password reset functionality. The system must support sending password reset links to registered emails and allow users to securely reset their password through the provided link.

---

### Core Features

1. **User Signup**

   - Endpoint: `POST /signup`
   - Accepts: name, email, password
   - Stores hashed password using bcrypt.
   - Ensures email uniqueness.

2. **User Login**

   - Endpoint: `POST /login`
   - Accepts: email, password
   - Verifies user and password.
   - Returns JWT access token on success.

3. **Forgot Password**

   - Endpoint: `POST /forgot-password`
   - Accepts: email
   - Validates if the email exists.
   - Generates a time-limited reset token (JWT or UUID).
   - Sends an email to the user with a secure password reset link (e.g., `/reset-password/:token`).

4. **Reset Password**

   - Endpoint: `POST /reset-password/:token`
   - Accepts: new password
   - Verifies the token’s validity and expiration.
   - Updates the user's password after hashing.
   - Optionally invalidates old tokens and sessions.

### Technical Requirements

- **Authentication:** JWT-based
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt
- **Email Service:** Use nodemailer (mock SMTP config or real)
- **Token Handling:**

  - Can use JWT with expiration (`resetPasswordToken`)
  - Or use a UUID stored in DB with expiration time

- **Token Expiry:** Recommended 15–30 minutes
- **Security Considerations:**

  - Do not disclose whether email exists in forgot-password response
  - Store tokens securely and invalidate after use
  - Rate-limit the forgot-password endpoint

---

### Optional: Frontend Integration

- Not mandatory.
- Frontend may consume the backend endpoints.
- Password reset email can link to a frontend route (e.g., `/reset-password/:token`) that captures the new password and sends it to the backend.

---

### Bonus Features (Optional for Extension)

- Rate limiting login and forgot-password routes
- Email verification during signup
- Logout and token blacklisting
- Mobile number-based recovery (alternative to email)
