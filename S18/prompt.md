---

## ‚úÖ **Session Title: Standard Coding Practices in Node.js Backend Development**

### üß† **Learning Objectives**

* Understand the importance of clean and maintainable code.
* Identify best practices in backend project structure and code organization.
* Apply naming conventions, modular design, and environment handling.
* Leverage tools like ESLint, Prettier, and dotenv for standardization.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Why Coding Standards Matter**

> ‚ÄúWrite code for others to read, not just for machines to execute.‚Äù

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* Easier debugging & collaboration.
* Simplifies onboarding of new devs.
* Prevents technical debt.
* Prepares code for CI/CD and deployment environments.
* Improves chances of code reuse in microservices or larger apps.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Folder Structure & Project Layout**

Use clear, modular folder organization.

### ‚úÖ Recommended Structure (for MVC/API Projects)

|- routes/           ‚Üí Route definitions
|- controllers/      ‚Üí Business logic handlers
|- models/           ‚Üí Mongoose schemas
|- middlewares/      ‚Üí Authentication, validation, etc.
|- services/         ‚Üí External logic (e.g., email, payment)
|- config/           ‚Üí DB, environment configs
|- utils/            ‚Üí Reusable helper functions
|- tests/            ‚Üí Test files
|- .env              ‚Üí Environment variables
|- app.js / index.js ‚Üí Entry point


> üî∏ **Tip:** Stick to *one job per file*. Keep files short and focused.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Naming Conventions**

Follow consistent naming across files, variables, and functions.

| Element       | Convention    | Example              |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Files/Folders | kebab-case  | user-routes.js     |
| Variables     | camelCase   | userId, isActive |
| Constants     | UPPER_SNAKE | JWT_SECRET         |
| Classes       | PascalCase  | UserController     |
| Functions     | camelCase   | sendEmail()        |

> üî∏ **Tip:** Name functions and variables based on their purpose, not their type.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Environment Variables**

Use .env files to avoid hardcoding secrets.

### ‚úÖ Example

.env

env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey


config.js

js
require('dotenv').config();
module.exports = {
  port: process.env.PORT,
  mongoUri: process.env.MONGO_URI,
  jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
};


> üõë **Never commit .env to Git!** Add it to .gitignore.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Code Modularity**

Break your code into reusable, single-responsibility modules.

### ‚ùå Bad:

js
// In routes/user.js
router.post("/register", async (req, res) => {
  // validation, hashing, DB save, email send
});


### ‚úÖ Good:

* validateUserInput()
* hashPassword()
* saveUserToDB()
* sendWelcomeEmail()

Each function goes in its appropriate service/util/helper.

> üß† Use the **Separation of Concerns** principle.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Error Handling**

Always use centralized error handling middleware.

### ‚úÖ Example:

js
// middleware/errorHandler.js
function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
  console.error(err);
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({ message: err.message || "Internal Server Error" });
}


And in app.js:

js
app.use(errorHandler);


> üî∏ Tip: Define custom error classes like BadRequestError, UnauthorizedError.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Consistent Response Structure**

Ensure uniformity in API responses.

### ‚úÖ Example:

js
{
  success: true,
  data: { id: 123, name: "John" },
  message: "User created successfully"
}


> üîÅ Add a responseHelper.js utility to generate consistent responses.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Linting & Formatting Tools**

### üßπ ESLint

* Enforces code style and error prevention.
* Integrate with VSCode and pre-commit hooks.

### üßº Prettier

* Auto-formats your code for style consistency.

### ‚úÖ Example Config:

bash
npm install eslint prettier --save-dev


.eslintrc.js

js
module.exports = {
  env: {
    node: true,
    es2021: true,
  },
  extends: ['eslint:recommended'],
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 12,
  },
  rules: {
    semi: ['error', 'always'],
    quotes: ['error', 'single'],
  },
};


.prettierrc

json
{
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "tabWidth": 2
}


> üîÅ Use "format on save" in VSCode settings for automation.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ **Versioning Your APIs**

When evolving APIs, maintain backward compatibility.

js
// Example:
GET /api/v1/users
GET /api/v2/users


> üß† You don‚Äôt break old consumers when you evolve your backend.

---

## üîü **Testing Awareness**

Introduce a minimal culture of testing.

* Use Jest or Mocha for backend testing.
* Write at least basic unit tests for critical routes/services.
* Encourage **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in long term.

---
