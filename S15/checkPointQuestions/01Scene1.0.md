### **In a typical WebSocket communication model, what role does the `socket.emit('eventName', data)` function play?**

A) It listens for data from the server
B) It establishes the socket connection
C) It sends a named event with data from client to server (or vice versa)
D) It terminates the socket connection gracefully

**Answer:** C) It sends a named event with data from client to server (or vice versa)

### **What is a key difference between the HTTP `req → res` cycle and socket-based communication?**

A) HTTP allows bidirectional communication, while sockets are only unidirectional
B) HTTP `req → res` ends after one response, while sockets keep a persistent connection for real-time, bidirectional data exchange
C) Sockets cannot be used in web browsers
D) HTTP is only used for frontend logic, while sockets are only for databases

**Answer:** B) HTTP `req → res` ends after one response, while sockets keep a persistent connection for real-time, bidirectional data exchange
