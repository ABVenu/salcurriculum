## Assignment 2: **Build a Real-Time Group Chat App with Admin Messaging**

### Objective:

Create a **real-time group chat application** using **Node.js, Express, Socket.IO**, and optionally **Redis/MongoDB**, focusing on event-driven design, multi-user interaction, and persistent storage.

---

### Problem Statement:

Design a chat system that supports **group messaging**, shows **online users**, and enables **admin announcements** to all. The app should demonstrate use of `socket.io` events and maintain a chat history.

---

### Core Features:

1. **User Registration / Join:**

   * Users should register with a name.
   * On connection, the user should appear in the **online users list** for all.
   * If a user refreshes or rejoins, their name must persist or be added again.

2. **Group Chat:**

   * All users can send and receive messages.
   * Chats should be visible in real-time to all users.
   * Store messages in a local array in server memory.

3. **Admin Messaging:**

   * Allow an admin user (identified by name or flag) to send broadcast messages like announcements or alerts.

4. **Disconnect Handling:**

   * User should be removed from the online users list when disconnected.
   * Provide a **"Disconnect" button** in the UI to manually disconnect from the server.

5. **Registered Users Only:**

   * Only registered users should be able to see and participate in the chat.

---

### Additional Feature:

6. **Chat History Persistence:**

   * Store chat messages in Redis (for faster retrieval) and backup periodically to MongoDB using a cron job.
   * On reconnect, show recent chat history fetched from Redis.

---

### Optional Bonus Feature:

7. **Personalized Chats Using Rooms:**

   * Users should be able to create or join private rooms (like `room1`, `room2`).
   * Only users in the same room can see and send messages to each other.

---

### Tech Stack:

* Node.js, Express
* socket.io
* HTML/CSS frontend (React optional)
* Redis (for fast cache/chat history)
* MongoDB (for chat backups)
* `node-cron` (for periodic backup)

---
### Submission Instructions:
* Once App is ready, push the code into Github & Submit the Github Repo Link
