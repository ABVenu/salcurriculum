## Assignment 1: **Explore Event-Driven Architecture with Node.js**

### Objective:

Gain hands-on understanding of **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** in Node.js by simulating a real-time system using custom events.

---

### Problem Statement:

Build a Node.js CLI application (or simple terminal app) that mimics a **Real-Time Notification System** using `EventEmitter`. The app should have:

#### Core Requirements:

- Use the native `events` module in Node.js.
- Define **custom events** like:

  - `userLoggedIn`
  - `messageReceived`
  - `dataSynced`

- Register multiple listeners for some events (e.g., logging, notification).
- Simulate a sequence of asynchronous operations using `setTimeout` or `setInterval` and emit events accordingly.

#### Sample Use Case:

```bash
$ node app.js
> User John logged in
> Notification sent to John
> Syncing user data...
> Data sync complete
```

### Submission Instructions:

- Once App is ready, push the code into Github & Submit the Github Repo Link
