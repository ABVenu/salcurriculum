### **Assignment: Fullstack User Management System with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

#### **Objective:**

Build a fullstack application that allows role-based user authentication and protected CRUD operations on user and resource data. Integrate frontend with backend APIs, use MongoDB Atlas for storage, and deploy both applications. Submit documentation and working links.

---

### **Modules & Requirements:**

#### 1. **Backend – Node.js, Express, MongoDB**

* Use your previously created backend with:

  * User Authentication (`/register`, `/login`) using **JWT**

  * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for roles like `admin`, `moderator`, and `user`

  * Protected CRUD routes:

    * `/users` – Admin can view all users
    * `/profile` – User can view and update own profile
    * `/resources` – CRUD on a generic "resource" entity (e.g., posts/tasks/items), accessible based on roles

  * Middleware for verifying token, checking roles, and input validation

  * Use MongoDB Atlas for database (no local Mongo)

  * If not already created, **build this backend from scratch.**

---

#### 2. **Frontend – HTML/CSS or React**

* Build a frontend client (either plain HTML/CSS/JS or React) that:

  * Provides forms for user login and registration
  * Displays dynamic views based on role (e.g., Admin Dashboard, User Home)
  * Performs CRUD on resource (create, view, update, delete)
  * Shows error/success messages clearly
  * Stores JWT securely (use localStorage/sessionStorage cautiously)

---

#### 3. **Integration**

* Connect the frontend to backend APIs:

  * Use fetch or axios for API calls
  * Use protected routes only when JWT is available
  * Ensure proper error handling for unauthorized access

---

#### 4. **Deployment**

* Deploy backend to Render / Railway / Cyclic / Fly.io
* Deploy frontend to Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages
* Use environment variables for sensitive data like JWT\_SECRET, DB\_URI

---

#### 5. **Documentation (README.md) – must include:**

* Project overview and features
* Tech stack used (Backend, Frontend, DB, Deployment platforms)
* Folder structure and setup steps for both frontend and backend
* API documentation (table format ideal: Endpoint, Method, Access, Description)
* Screenshots or video walkthrough (if possible)
* Live Links:

  * Backend Deployment URL
  * Frontend Deployment URL
  * GitHub Repo (Frontend)
  * GitHub Repo (Backend)

---

### **Submission Instruction**

* GitHub Repo 1: Backend with clear folder structure and `.env.example`
* GitHub Repo 2: Frontend with clean structure
* `README.md` in both repos with proper documentation
* Live deployed links of both frontend and backend
