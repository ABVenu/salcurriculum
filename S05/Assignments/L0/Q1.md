### **L0: Implementing Rate Limiting in Express (5 Requests/Minute)**  

#### **Objective:**  
Learn how to integrate and use the **rate-limiting middleware** in an Express.js application to restrict excessive API usage by setting a request limit per user.  

#### **Problem Statement:**  

1. **Initialize** a **Node.js** project and install **Express.js** along with `express-rate-limit` (`npm install express express-rate-limit`).  

2. **Set up an Express app (`index.js`)** and configure the **rate limiter middleware** with the following settings:  
   - Allow a maximum of **5 requests per minute** per client.  
   - If the limit is exceeded, respond with `{ error: "Too many requests, please try again later." }`.  

3. **Create a `routes/` folder** and define a single route file `api.js`, handling the following endpoints:  
   - `GET /api/public` → Respond with `{ message: "This is a public endpoint!" }` (No rate limiting).  
   - `GET /api/limited` → Apply rate limiting (5 requests per minute) and respond with `{ message: "You have access to this limited endpoint!" }`.  

4. **Import and use the router in `index.js`**, ensuring the rate limiter is applied **only to the `/api/limited`** route.  

5. **Manage undefined routes**, responding with `{ error: "404 Not Found" }`.  

#### **Expected Output Examples:**  
- `GET /api/public` → `{ "message": "This is a public endpoint!" }`  
- `GET /api/limited` (if within limit) → `{ "message": "You have access to this limited endpoint!" }`  
- `GET /api/limited` (after **5 requests within a minute**) → `{ "error": "Too many requests, please try again later." }`  
- Visiting an undefined route should return `{ "error": "404 Not Found" }`.  

### **Other Instructions**  
- Ensure **rate limiting is applied only to `/api/limited`**.  
- Use **modular code structure** with separate files for routes.  
- Test rate limits using **Postman or cURL** by sending multiple requests.  

### **Submission Guidelines**  
- Push your code to a **Masai GitHub repository**.
