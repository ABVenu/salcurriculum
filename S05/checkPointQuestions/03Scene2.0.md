### **2.0 - Introduction to Databases & MongoDB Concepts**

#### **1. Why do we need a database instead of storing data in files?**

A) Databases are slower but provide better UI.  
B) Databases help in efficient data storage, retrieval, and management
C) Files can store unlimited data without any structure.  
D) Databases are required only for large-scale applications.

## **Answer:** B) Databases help in efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.

#### **2. Which of the following is a NoSQL database?**

A) MySQL  
B) PostgreSQL  
C) MongoDB
D) Oracle

**Answer:** C) MongoDB

#### **3. What is a key difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**

A) SQL databases store unstructured data, while NoSQL stores structured data.  
B) SQL databases use tables, whereas NoSQL databases use flexible document-based storage.
C) NoSQL databases do not support indexing, while SQL databases do.  
D) NoSQL databases can only be used for small-scale applications.

**Answer:** B) SQL databases use tables, whereas NoSQL databases use flexible document-based storage

#### 4. **Which of the following correctly differentiates MongoDB from other NoSQL databases?**

A) MongoDB stores data in tables, while other NoSQL databases use key-value pairs.  
B) MongoDB is a relational database, while other NoSQL databases are non-relational.  
C) MongoDB stores data in document format, while other NoSQL databases may use key-value, column-family, or graph-based storage.  
D) MongoDB requires a fixed schema, whereas other NoSQL databases allow schema flexibility.

**Answer:** C) MongoDB stores data in document format, while other NoSQL databases may use key-value, column-family, or graph-based storage.

### 5. **Which type of database is best suited for live gaming updates?**

A) SQL  
B) NoSQL  
C) None of the above  
D) Both

**Answer:** **B) NoSQL**

**Explanation:** NoSQL databases, especially key-value stores like Redis, are best suited for live gaming updates because they offer high-speed data access, low latency, and scalability, which are essential for real-time applications.
