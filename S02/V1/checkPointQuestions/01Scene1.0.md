C) It is used only for frontend development  
D) It replaces the need for `node_modules`

**Correct Answer:** **B** (It defines metadata, dependencies, and scripts for the project)

### **2. What happens when you run `npm install` without any package name?**

A) It installs npm globally  
B) It updates all globally installed packages  
C) It installs all dependencies listed in `package.json` into `node_modules`

**Correct Answer:** **C** (It installs all dependencies listed in `package.json` into `node_modules`)

### **3. How do you install a package globally in npm?**

A) `npm install package-name`  
B) `npm install -g package-name`  
C) `npm install --global package-name`  
D) Both B and C

**Correct Answer:** **D** (Both `npm install -g package-name` and `npm install --global package-name`)

4. ### **What is the role of the `node_modules` folder?**
   A) It stores all locally installed dependencies of the project  
   B) It contains the `package.json` file  
   C) It is used to write custom modules for a Node.js app

5. ### How does a `dependency` differ from a `package` in Node.js?

   A) A dependency is a required package that another package relies on, while a package is a bundle of JavaScript modules with metadata.
   B) A package can be installed globally, but a dependency must always be local.
   C) A package is always built-in to Node.js, but a dependency must be installed separately.
   D) A dependency must always be a library, whereas a package can be anything.

   ### Solution:

   **Option A:** A **dependency** is a package that another package relies on, while a **package** is a bundle of JavaScript modules with metadata.
