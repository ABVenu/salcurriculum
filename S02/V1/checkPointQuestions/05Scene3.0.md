### **1. Why is an API testing tool required?**

A) To manually test APIs by writing code for each request  
B) To automate API requests, validate responses, and simulate real-world scenarios  
C) To replace backend development entirely  
D) To generate frontend UI designs

**Correct Answer:** **B** (To automate API requests, validate responses, and simulate real-world scenarios) **Explanation:** API testing tools help developers **test API endpoints, automate requests, and validate responses** efficiently without manually writing scripts for every test.

### **2. What are the key benefits of using Postman for API testing?**

A) It allows sending HTTP requests and validating responses without writing code  
B) It integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated API testing  
C) It supports collections, pre-request scripts, and test automation  
D) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** **D** (All of the above)  
**Explanation:** Postman provides a **user-friendly interface**, **automation capabilities**, and **integration with DevOps workflows**, making API testing efficient.

### **3. Which of the following is a best practice when using Postman?**

A) Hardcoding API keys in every request  
B) Organizing requests into collections
C) Sending API requests without checking response codes  
D) Only using Postman for manual testing without automation

**Correct Answer:** **B** (Organizing requests into collections)  
**Explanation:** Using **collections**, **variables**, and **tests** improves API request organization, reusability, and automation in Postman.

### **4. How does Postman act as a simulation of the frontend?**

A) It allows developers to test API responses without needing an actual frontend application  
B) It automatically generates a full UI for APIs  
C) It converts API responses into frontend UI components  
D) It only works when connected to a frontend framework like React or Angular

**Correct Answer:** **A** (It allows developers to test API responses without needing an actual frontend application)  
**Explanation:** Postman **simulates frontend behavior** by sending API requests and receiving responses just as a real frontend would, allowing testing without a full UI.
