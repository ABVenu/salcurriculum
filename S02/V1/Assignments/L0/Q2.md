### **L1: Exploring & Implementing the Chalk Module in Node.js**  

#### **Objective:**  

Get familiar with using **external NPM modules** in Node.js by installing and using the `chalk` package (**version 4.0.0**) to print styled messages in the console.  

---

### **Problem Statement:**  

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project** using:  
   ```sh
   npm init -y
   ```  
2. **Install the `chalk` package (specific version `4.0.0`)** using:  
   ```sh
   npm i chalk@4.0.0
   ```  
3. **Create a file named `index.js`** that:  
   - Imports the `chalk` module.  
   - Prints **two messages in different colors**:  
     - `"Hello, World!"` in **blue**.  
     - `"Learning Chalk is fun!"` in **yellow**.  
   - Prints **two messages with background colors**:  
     - `"Warning! Proceed with caution."` with **black text on a yellow background**.  
     - `"Error! Something went wrong."` with **white text on a red background**.  
   - Prints **two messages with multiple colors in the same console output**:  
     - `"Success: Operation completed!"` with `"Success:"` in **green** and `"Operation completed!"` in **white**.  
     - `"Loading... Please wait"` with `"Loading..."` in **cyan** and `"Please wait"` in **magenta**.  
   - Defines **custom themes** for consistent styling:  
     - **Error** â†’ Bold **red** text.  
     - **Warning** â†’ Bold **orange** text.  
     - **Success** â†’ Bold **green** text.  
   - Uses these themes to print:  
     - `"Error: Unable to connect to the server!"` using the **Error** theme.  
     - `"Warning: Low disk space!"` using the **Warning** theme.  
     - `"Success: Data saved successfully!"` using the **Success** theme.  

4. **Run the program using Node.js**:  
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

### **Expected Output Example (Console):**  
*(Colors won't be visible here, but they'll be styled in your terminal when executed.)*  

```
Hello, World!  (Blue)
Learning Chalk is fun!  (Yellow)

Warning! Proceed with caution.  (Black text on Yellow background)
Error! Something went wrong.  (White text on Red background)

Success: Operation completed!  (Success: Green, Operation completed!: White)
Loading... Please wait  (Loading... Cyan, Please wait Magenta)

Error: Unable to connect to the server!  (Bold Red)
Warning: Low disk space!  (Bold Orange)
Success: Data saved successfully!  (Bold Green)
```
