C) To generate frontend UI  
D) To run JavaScript code in the browser

### **2. In Express.js, what method is used to define a GET route?**  
A) `app.get()`  
B) `app.post()`  
C) `app.route()`  
D) `app.fetch()`  

**Correct Answer:** **A** (`app.get()`)  


3. ### **Which of the following best describes the difference between a URL and a specific URL?**  

A) A **URL** is a general format for accessing resources, while a **specific URL** points to an exact resource or endpoint.  

B) A **URL** is only used in frontend development, while a **specific URL** is used in backend APIs.  

C) A **URL** is the domain name, and a **specific URL** is only used for dynamic routes.  

D) A **URL** is only used for GET requests, while a **specific URL** can handle all HTTP methods.  

**Correct Answer:** **A**  
**Explanation:** A **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is a general format that defines web addresses (e.g., `https://example.com/api/users`), while a **specific URL** refers to a fully defined address pointing to a particular resource (e.g., `https://example.com/api/users/123`).  



4. ### **What is the difference between an endpoint and a route in an Express.js server?**  

A) A route is the full URL, and an endpoint is only the base domain  
B) A route is a specific **endpoint + HTTP method**, while an endpoint is a specific URL that responds to a request  
C) There is no difference; both terms mean the same thing  
D) An endpoint is only for GET requests, while a route can handle all HTTP methods  

‚úÖ **Correct Answer:** **B**  
üìù **Explanation:**  
- A **route** in Express.js is defined by a **specific HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and an endpoint** (e.g., `app.get('/users')`).  
- An **endpoint** is just the **URL path** where the server listens for requests (e.g., `/users`).  


5. ### **What does the following Express route do?**  
```js
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Login successful');
});
```
A) Defines a route that handles GET requests at `/login`  
B) Defines a route that handles POST requests at `/login`  
C) Defines a global middleware for authentication  
D) Sends an automatic response to all routes  

**Correct Answer:** **B** (Defines a route that handles POST requests at `/login`)

**Scene 2.1**
Here are **three more MCQs** related to **server, route, Express, URL, and endpoint**:  

---

1. ### **In Express.js, what happens if a request is made to a route that is not defined?**  

A) The request is ignored, and nothing happens  
B) Express automatically redirects to the homepage (`/`)  
C) The request remains unhandled
D) The server crashes  

**Correct Answer:** **C** The request remains unhandled

---
2. ### **What is required to create a basic Express.js server?**  

A) Importing Express, creating an `app` instance, defining routes, and starting the server  
B) Installing a database and setting up authentication  
C) Writing only frontend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files  
D) Running `express --start` in the terminal  

**Correct Answer:** **A** (Importing Express, creating an `app` instance, defining routes, and starting the server) 

3. ### **Which of the following best describes an Express.js route?**  

A) A function that handles a specific HTTP request type at a defined URL  
B) A database query that retrieves data from the backend  
C) A middleware function that runs before a request reaches the server  
D) A method used to connect Express to a frontend framework  

**Correct Answer:** **A** (A function that handles a specific HTTP request type at a defined URL)  
üìù **Explanation:** A **route** in Express.js defines how the server **responds to client requests** based on the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and a URL pattern.

### **1. Why is an API testing tool required?**  

A) To manually test APIs by writing code for each request  
B) To automate API requests, validate responses, and simulate real-world scenarios  
C) To replace backend development entirely  
D) To generate frontend UI designs  

**Correct Answer:** **B** (To automate API requests, validate responses, and simulate real-world scenarios)   **Explanation:** API testing tools help developers **test API endpoints, automate requests, and validate responses** efficiently without manually writing scripts for every test.  



### **2. What are the key benefits of using Postman for API testing?**  

A) It allows sending HTTP requests and validating responses without writing code  
B) It integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated API testing  
C) It supports collections, pre-request scripts, and test automation  
D) All of the above  

**Correct Answer:** **D** (All of the above)  
**Explanation:** Postman provides a **user-friendly interface**, **automation capabilities**, and **integration with DevOps workflows**, making API testing efficient.  

---

### **3. Which of the following is a best practice when using Postman?**  

A) Hardcoding API keys in every request  
B) Organizing requests into collections
C) Sending API requests without checking response codes  
D) Only using Postman for manual testing without automation  

**Correct Answer:** **B** (Organizing requests into collections)  
**Explanation:** Using **collections**, **variables**, and **tests** improves API request organization, reusability, and automation in Postman.  

---

### **4. How does Postman act as a simulation of the frontend?**  

A) It allows developers to test API responses without needing an actual frontend application  
B) It automatically generates a full UI for APIs  
C) It converts API responses into frontend UI components  
D) It only works when connected to a frontend framework like React or Angular  

**Correct Answer:** **A** (It allows developers to test API responses without needing an actual frontend application)  
**Explanation:** Postman **simulates frontend behavior** by sending API requests and receiving responses just as a real frontend would, allowing testing without a full UI.
