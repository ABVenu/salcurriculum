##  L2: Extend Redis + Cron Job Workflow with Reporting and Email Notifications

### Problem Statement:

Building on your existing Books Management API with Redis caching and bulk insertion via cron job, you now need to:

---

### New Requirements:

#### 1. Track Bulk Insertion Status in Redis:

* After the **bulk books insertion cron job** finishes processing a user’s bulk books:

  * Update a **status record** in Redis for that user containing:

    * Count of successfully inserted books.
    * Count of failed insertions (if any).
    * User ID.
    * Date/time of processing.

* This status info should be stored separately per user to support multiple users concurrently.

#### 2. Generate and Send Report via Another Cron Job:

* Implement a **second cron job** that runs periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes).
* This job should:

  * Fetch the bulk insertion status records for all users from Redis.
  * For each user with a status:

    * Generate a **PDF report** summarizing the bulk insertion results (successes, failures, timestamp, user ID).
    * Send the report as an **email attachment** to the user’s registered email address.
    * After successfully sending the email, **delete the status record** for that user from Redis to avoid repeated reports.

#### 3. Multiuser Support:

* The solution should properly handle multiple users submitting bulk book requests and receiving separate reports concurrently.
* Redis keys and data must be scoped by user to ensure isolation.
* Cron jobs should be efficient and fault-tolerant for concurrent multiuser processing.

---

### Expectations & Notes:

* The email sending can be done using popular Node.js libraries like `nodemailer`.
* PDF generation can be implemented using libraries such as `pdfkit` or `puppeteer`.
* Make sure the status updates and report generation are consistent, with proper error handling.
* The system should not resend reports once a status record is deleted after emailing.
* Include timestamps and relevant metadata in the report for clarity.
* Ensure secure and efficient Redis usage, especially for concurrent user data.

---

### Deliverables:

* Updated API with bulk insertion status tracking in Redis.
* Two cron jobs:

  * One for bulk book insertion (already implemented).
  * One for report generation and email sending (new).
* Sample email report PDF structure demonstrating all required info.
* Instructions on how to simulate multiple users and verify concurrent handling.
* Proper logging to verify cron job activities and email dispatch.

---
This task deepens understanding of:

* State management in Redis across multiple asynchronous jobs.
* Generating dynamic PDF reports in backend systems.
* Integrating email services into cron-based workflows.
* Handling concurrency and isolation in multiuser environments.
