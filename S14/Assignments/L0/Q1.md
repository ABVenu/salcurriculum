### **L0:Implement Simple Redis Caching with Invalidation**

#### Objective:

Create a Node.js + Express application that demonstrates **how Redis can be used as a caching layer** for GET requests, and how to **invalidate (delete) the cache** when the underlying data is modified (added/updated/deleted).

---

### **Assignment Requirements**

1. **Setup**:

   - Use Express for the server.
   - Use Redis (via `ioredis` or `redis` npm package).
   - Use a simple in-memory JS array or a JSON file for simulating the database (no need for MongoDB for this task).

2. **Routes to Implement**:

   - `GET /items` → Fetches all items.

     - If data is present in Redis cache, return cached data.
     - If not, fetch from "database", cache it, and return response.

   - `POST /items` → Adds a new item.

     - Should invalidate the `/items` cache after a successful add.

   - `PUT /items/:id` → Updates an item by ID.

     - Should invalidate the `/items` cache after successful update.

   - `DELETE /items/:id` → Deletes an item by ID.

     - Should invalidate the `/items` cache after successful delete.

3. **Caching Behavior**:

   - Use Redis `get` and `set` methods.
   - Cache data with a key like `items:all`.
   - Set an optional TTL (Time To Live) of 1 minute for the cache using `EX`.

---

### Example Flow

1. First `GET /items` → data is fetched from DB and cached in Redis.
2. Second `GET /items` → data is returned from Redis.
3. `POST /items` → adds new item → Redis key is deleted.
4. `GET /items` again → cache miss → data is re-fetched and re-cached.

---

### Success Criteria

- Correct use of Redis caching (`get`, `set`, and `del`).
- Correct invalidation of cache on POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Data is returned from Redis if already cached.
- Console logs should clearly indicate cache hits or misses.

### **Submission Guidelines**

- Submit a **GitHub repo** with your code.
- Provide a **README** with setup instructions.
