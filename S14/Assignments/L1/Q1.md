## L1: Redis Caching + Cron Job for Bulk Book Processing in a Books App

### Problem Statement:

You are tasked with building a **Books Management API** using Node.js and Express that supports user authentication and CRUD operations for books, enhanced with Redis caching and a cron job for bulk book insertion.

---

### Requirements:

#### 1. User Authentication:

* Implement routes for user **signup** and **login**.
* Authentication can be session-based, JWT-based, or any secure method.
* Each authenticated user should have their own isolated data namespace in Redis.

#### 2. Book CRUD Operations:

* Implement standard CRUD routes for managing books:

  * `GET /books` - List all books for the authenticated user.
  * `POST /books` - Add a new book.
  * `PUT /books/:id` - Update a book by ID.
  * `DELETE /books/:id` - Delete a book by ID.

#### 3. Redis Caching:

* Cache the response of the `GET /books` route in Redis for each user separately.
* Subsequent GET requests should serve data from Redis if available.
* On any change (add, update, delete), invalidate the corresponding Redis cache for that user.

#### 4. Bulk Books Insertion via Redis + Cron Job:

* Implement a route: `POST /books/bulk`

  * Accepts an **array of books** for the authenticated user.
  * Instead of immediately inserting into the database, store this array in Redis under a user-specific key.
  * Return a response immediately: `"Books will be added later."`

* Implement a **cron job** that runs every **2 minutes**.

  * The job should read all pending bulk book arrays from Redis for all users.
  * For each user, insert the bulk books into the database.
  * Remove the processed entries from Redis after successful insertion.

---

### Additional Expectations:

* Redis keys for caching and bulk books must be scoped by user ID or username to ensure data separation.
* Proper error handling and validation.
* Efficient Redis usage (e.g., using hashes or sets as appropriate).
* Secure handling of user authentication tokens or sessions.
* The cron job should not block the main app and should handle failures gracefully.

---

### Deliverables:

* Fully functional API supporting the above features.
* Documentation/comments explaining how caching and cron jobs are implemented.
* Instructions on how to test the bulk books insertion flow with Redis and cron jobs.
