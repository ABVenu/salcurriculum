## **L2: Movie Booking System API (Mongoose Aggregation)**

### **Objective:**

Build an API to manage **movies, users, and bookings**, and use **Mongoose aggregation pipelines** in Express routes to derive useful analytics.

---

### **Collections & Schemas**

#### `movies` Collection

```js
const movieSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  _id: String, // e.g., "M1"
  title: String,
  genre: String,
  releaseYear: Number,
  durationMins: Number,
});
```

#### `users` Collection

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  _id: String, // e.g., "U1"
  name: String,
  email: String,
  joinedAt: Date,
});
```

#### `bookings` Collection

```js
const bookingSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  _id: String, // e.g., "B1"
  userId: String,
  movieId: String,
  bookingDate: Date,
  seats: Number,
  status: String, // "Booked", "Cancelled"
});
```

---

## **Required Routes**

### 1. **Create Routes**

- **POST `/movies`** â†’ Create a movie document
- **POST `/users`** â†’ Register a user
- **POST `/bookings`** â†’ Create a booking (only for existing users & movies)

---

## **Aggregation Routes (Mongoose pipelines)**

> All routes must use **Mongoose Aggregation**, not `.populate()`
> Use `$lookup`, `$unwind`, `$group`, `$project`, `$match`, `$sort`, etc.

---

### Route 1: `/analytics/movie-bookings`

**Get total bookings and total seats booked per movie**

---

### Route 2: `/analytics/user-bookings`

**Get booking history for each user with movie titles**

---

### Route 3: `/analytics/top-users`

**Find users who booked more than 2 times**

---

### Route 4: `/analytics/genre-wise-bookings`

**Total seats booked per genre**

---

### Route 5: `/analytics/active-bookings`

**Get all current active ("Booked") bookings with movie and user details**

---

## ðŸ§ª Sample Aggregation Code Snippet (for students):

```js
Booking.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "Booked" } },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "users",
      localField: "userId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "user",
    },
  },
  { $unwind: "$user" },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "movies",
      localField: "movieId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "movie",
    },
  },
  { $unwind: "$movie" },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      userName: "$user.name",
      movieTitle: "$movie.title",
      seats: 1,
      bookingDate: 1,
    },
  },
]);
```
