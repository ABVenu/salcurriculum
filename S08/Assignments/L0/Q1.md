# **L0: One-to-One Relationships in Mongoose**

### **Total Objective**

Create basic Mongoose schemas for a simple One-to-One relational structure. Insert data into both collections and ensure relationships are established properly. This will help students understand how to design and implement One-to-One relationships in Mongoose.

---

### **Problem Statement**

Implement a **User-Profile relationship** where:

- Each user can have exactly one profile.
- The profile stores additional information like bio and social media links.
- This type of relationship is commonly used in applications where users have separate profile details.

---

## **Schema Design**

### **User Schema**

- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters
- `email`: String, required, unique

### **Profile Schema**

- `bio`: String, optional
- `socialMediaLinks`: Array of strings, optional
- `user`: ObjectId, required (reference to the `User` collection), unique (to ensure One-to-One relationship)

---

### **Routes**

1. **Add User** (`POST /add-user`):

   - Add a new user with `name` and `email` fields.

2. **Add Profile** (`POST /add-profile`):
   - Add a profile with `bio`, `socialMediaLinks`, and `user` reference. Ensure the user reference is valid and unique.

---

## **Instructions**

1. **Schema Creation**:

   - Create two separate schemas (User and Profile).
   - Ensure relationships are defined properly using `ObjectId` for references.

2. **Insert Data**:

   - Insert a few users and profiles manually to test the relationship.

3. **Relationship Verification**:
   - Print all profiles, including the userâ€™s name (use `.populate()` in Mongoose to fetch the related user).

## **Example Task Data**

1. **User**:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Jane Smith",
     "email": "jane@example.com"
   }
   ```

2. **Profile**:
   ```json
   {
     "bio": "Software Developer and Tech Enthusiast",
     "socialMediaLinks": [
       "https://twitter.com/jane",
       "https://linkedin.com/in/jane"
     ],
     "user": "ObjectId_of_user"
   }
   ```

---

## **Good Practices**

- Ensure proper validation for required fields.
- Use meaningful error messages for missing or invalid data.
- Maintain file structure with folders (e.g., `models/` and `routes/`).
