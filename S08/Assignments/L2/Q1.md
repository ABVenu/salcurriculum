# **L2: Library Management System**  

### **Total Objective**  
Develop a **Library Management System** using Mongoose with two schemas: `Book` and `Member`. Implement CRUD operations for both schemas, with functionality to borrow and return books. Utilize Mongoose’s `.populate()` method to display related data. Add **optional hooks (pre/post)** for validation and status updates.  

---

### **Problem Statement**  
Create a system where:  
- Members can borrow and return multiple books.  
- Each book can be borrowed by multiple members.  
- Implement pre/post hooks to automatically update the book status or validate data.  

---

## **Schema Design**  

### **Book Schema**  
- `title`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters  
- `author`: String, required  
- `status`: Enum, required, values `["available", "borrowed"]`  
- `borrowers`: Array of ObjectIds (references to `Member` schema)  
- `createdAt`: Date, default to the current date  

### **Member Schema**  
- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters  
- `email`: String, required, unique  
- `borrowedBooks`: Array of ObjectIds (references to `Book` schema)  

---

## **Routes**  

1. **Add Book** (`POST /add-book`):  
   - Create a new book with `title`, `author`, and default status set to `available`.  

2. **Add Member** (`POST /add-member`):  
   - Add a new member with `name` and `email`.  

3. **Borrow Book** (`POST /borrow-book`):  
   - Borrow a book, updating the book’s `status` to `borrowed` and adding the member to `borrowers`.  
   - Add the book to the member’s `borrowedBooks` list.  

4. **Return Book** (`POST /return-book`):  
   - Return a borrowed book, updating the `status` to `available` and removing the member from `borrowers`.  
   - Remove the book from the member’s `borrowedBooks` list.  

5. **Get Member Borrowed Books** (`GET /member-borrowed-books/:memberId`):  
   - Retrieve all books a member has borrowed using `.populate()`.  

6. **Get Book Borrowers** (`GET /book-borrowers/:bookId`):  
   - Retrieve all members who have borrowed a specific book using `.populate()`.  

7. **Update Book Details** (`PUT /update-book/:bookId`):  
   - Update book information, including `title` and `author`.  

8. **Delete Book** (`DELETE /delete-book/:bookId`):  
   - Delete a book and remove it from all members' `borrowedBooks` lists.  

---

## **Hooks (Optional)**  

1. **Pre Hook on Borrowing**:  
   - Before borrowing, check if the book is available.  

2. **Post Hook on Returning**:  
   - After returning, automatically update the book’s status to `available`.  

---

## **Instructions**  

1. **Schema Creation**:  
   - Use `ObjectId` references to establish relationships between `Member` and `Book`.  

2. **Data Population**:  
   - Use `.populate()` to display related data when retrieving information.  

3. **CRUD Operations**:  
   - Ensure robust CRUD functionality for both schemas.  

4. **Hooks**:  
   - Implement optional pre/post hooks to enhance system functionality.

## **Example Task Data**  

1. **Book**:  
   ```json  
   {  
     "title": "JavaScript: The Good Parts",  
     "author": "Douglas Crockford"  
   }  
   ```  

2. **Member**:  
   ```json  
   {  
     "name": "Alice Johnson",  
     "email": "alice@example.com"  
   }  
   ```  

---

## **Good Practices**  
- Ensure unique email validation for members and proper validation for all fields.  
- Implement meaningful error handling and status codes for all routes.  
- Keep the project modular (`models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`).  
- Use pre/post hooks to automate book status changes and validations.
