# **L1: Book Rental System with Mongoose**  

### **Total Objective**  
Create a **Book Rental System** using Mongoose with well-structured schemas for books and users. Implement CRUD operations for all entities and utilize the `.populate()` method to retrieve relational data between books and users effectively.  

---

### **Problem Statement**  
Develop a **Book Rental System** where:  
- A **User** can rent multiple **Books**.  
- Each **Book** can be rented by multiple users over time.  
- Perform CRUD operations on both collections and use `.populate()` to fetch relational data.  

---

## **Schema Design**  

### **User Schema**  
- `name`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters  
- `email`: String, required, unique  
- `rentedBooks`: Array of ObjectIds (references to the `Book` collection)  

### **Book Schema**  
- `title`: String, required, minimum length of 3 characters  
- `author`: String, required  
- `genre`: String, optional  
- `rentedBy`: Array of ObjectIds (references to the `User` collection)  

---

## **Routes**  

1. **Add User** (`POST /add-user`):  
   - Add a new user with `name` and `email`.  

2. **Add Book** (`POST /add-book`):  
   - Add a new book with `title`, `author`, and optional `genre`.  

3. **Rent Book** (`POST /rent-book`):  
   - Allow a user to rent a book. Update both `User.rentedBooks` and `Book.rentedBy` arrays accordingly.  

4. **Return Book** (`POST /return-book`):  
   - Allow a user to return a book. Remove the book reference from both `User` and `Book` collections.  

5. **Get User Rentals** (`GET /user-rentals/:userId`):  
   - Retrieve all books rented by a user using `.populate()`.  

6. **Get Book Renters** (`GET /book-renters/:bookId`):  
   - Retrieve all users who rented a specific book using `.populate()`.  

7. **Update Book** (`PUT /update-book/:bookId`):  
   - Update book details like `title`, `author`, or `genre`.  

8. **Delete Book** (`DELETE /delete-book/:bookId`):  
   - Delete a book and update all users' `rentedBooks` arrays to reflect the removal.  

---

## **Instructions**  

1. **Schema Creation**:  
   - Define `User` and `Book` schemas with proper relationships using `ObjectId` references.  

2. **Data Population**:  
   - Use `.populate()` to retrieve all relational data effectively.  

3. **CRUD Operations**:  
   - Ensure full CRUD operations on both `User` and `Book` entities, with proper relationship management for renting and returning books.

## **Example Task Data**  

1. **User**:  
   ```json  
   {  
     "name": "Jane Doe",  
     "email": "jane@example.com"  
   }  
   ```  

2. **Book**:  
   ```json  
   {  
     "title": "1984",  
     "author": "George Orwell",  
     "genre": "Dystopian"  
   }  
   ```  

---

## **Good Practices**  
- Ensure unique user emails and proper validation on all fields.  
- Implement meaningful error messages and status codes for all endpoints.  
- Use modular folder structure (`models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`).
