### **L2: Advanced Library Management System**

---

### **Total Objective**

Develop an advanced Library Management System using a single collection to handle books and users. This system will implement middleware-based validation, advanced business logic, and role-free borrowing limits (logic-driven). The system should also automatically handle due dates and overdue penalties without relying on enum or validation in the schema.

1. **Setup Folder Structure**  
   Maintain the following folder structure:
   ```
   project-root/
   ├── models/           # Mongoose models
   │   └── library.model.js
   ├── routes/           # Express routes
   │   └── library.routes.js
   ├── config/           # Configuration files
   │   └── db.js         # MongoDB connection logic
   ├── controllers/      # Controller logic
   │   └── library.controller.js
   ├── middleware/       # Middleware logic
   │   └── library.middleware.js  # Validation and business logic middleware
   ├── app.js            # Application entry point
   └── package.json
   ```

---

### **Model (library.model.js)**

Define a single schema that includes both book and user-related data:

```javascript
{
  title: String,  // For books
  author: String,
  status: String, // "available", "borrowed", "reserved"
  borrowerName: String,  // If borrowed
  borrowDate: Date,
  dueDate: Date,
  returnDate: Date,
  overdueFees: Number,  // Calculated on return if overdue
}
```

---

### **Middleware and Business Logic**

1. **Data Validation Middleware**

   - Ensure all required fields (`title`, `author`, etc.) are provided.
   - Respond with `"Incomplete Data"` if any field is missing.

2. **Borrowing Middleware**

   - Ensure no user borrows more than 3 books at a time.

3. **Overdue Fee Calculation**
   - Calculate overdue fees (e.g., Rs. 10 per day) when a book is returned late.
   - Automatically add the fee to the `overdueFees` field.

---

### **Advanced CRUD Operations**

1. **Add a Book (POST /library/books)**

   - Add a new book to the system with default `status` as `"available"`.

2. **Borrow a Book (PATCH /library/borrow/:id)**

   - Update the book’s `status` to `"borrowed"`.
   - Record the borrower’s name and the current date as the `borrowDate`.
   - Set the `dueDate` to 14 days from the `borrowDate`.
   - Apply borrowing limit middleware.

3. **Return a Book (PATCH /library/return/:id)**

   - Update the `status` to `"available"`.
   - Calculate overdue fees if the book is returned after the `dueDate` and store the fee in the `overdueFees` field.

4. **Retrieve Books (GET /library/books)**

   - Retrieve all books.
   - Allow optional filtering by `status` or `title` through query parameters.

5. **Delete a Book (DELETE /library/books/:id)**
   - Delete a book only if it is not currently borrowed.

### **Special Instructions**

- **Responses**:  
  Ensure all responses are clear, descriptive, and contain necessary details. Include success or error messages along with relevant data.

- **Status Codes**:  
  Use the appropriate HTTP status codes for each response:

  - `200 OK` for successful operations.
  - `201 Created` for resource creation (e.g., adding a book).
  - `400 Bad Request` for missing fields or invalid data.
  - `404 Not Found` for invalid IDs or non-existing resources.
  - `409 Conflict` for business logic errors (e.g., borrowing limit exceeded).
  - `500 Internal Server Error` for unexpected issues.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Proper error handling should be implemented at each step.
  - Return a descriptive error message and status code when necessary.
  - Ensure that if an operation fails, an appropriate response with an error message is sent.
  - Handle edge cases, such as trying to borrow more than 3 books or attempting to delete a borrowed book, with clear error responses.

### **Submission Instructions**

- Submit Masai repository link.
- Ensure all files and folders follow the specified structure.
- Middleware should be integrated for validation and business logic.
