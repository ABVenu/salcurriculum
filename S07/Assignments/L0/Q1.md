## **L0: User & Address Management System**

You are tasked with building a backend system using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB (Mongoose)** to manage **users** and their **multiple addresses**.

###  Requirements:

1. **Design Mongoose Schemas** for:

   - `User` with fields: `name`, `email`, `age`, and `addresses`

   - `Address` with fields: `street`, `city`, `state`, `country` (default: India), and `pincode`

   > You can choose to implement `addresses` as either **subdocuments** or **referenced documents** — justify your decision.
