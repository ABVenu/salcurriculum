### **L2: Vehicle Trip Management System**

You are building a **Vehicle Trip Management System** using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB with Mongoose**. Design it with a **single schema** that includes **nested subdocuments** and apply **schema validation** as well as **Mongoose queries beyond basic CRUD** (e.g., using `$gte`, `$lte`, `$in`, etc.).

---

### Schema Definition:

Create a **Vehicle** schema with the following structure:

```js
{
  registrationNumber: String (required, unique),
  type: String (enum: ['car', 'truck', 'bike'], required),
  model: String (required),
  isActive: Boolean (default: true),
  trips: [
    {
      startLocation: String (required),
      endLocation: String (required),
      distance: Number (required, must be > 0),
      startTime: Date (required),
      endTime: Date (required)
    }
  ]
}
```

Include Mongoose **validations** like:

- `distance` must be greater than 0
- `registrationNumber` must be unique
- Required fields must be enforced

---

### Functional Requirements:

#### A. Vehicle CRUD

1. Create a new vehicle
2. Get all vehicles
3. Update a vehicle's information
4. Delete a vehicle

#### B. Trip Operations (inside the `trips` array)

1. Add a new trip to a vehicle
2. Update a trip (by index or `_id`)
3. Delete a trip from a vehicle

---

### Queries Beyond CRUD (Use Mongoose query operators like `$gte`, `$lte`, `$in`, etc.)

1. **Get all vehicles that have a trip longer than 200 km**
   _Use `$elemMatch` with `$gte` on `distance` field._

2. **Find all vehicles with at least one trip starting from either 'Delhi', 'Mumbai', or 'Bangalore'**
   _Use `$elemMatch` and `$in` on `startLocation`._

3. **Get vehicles that have trips starting after Jan 1, 2024**
   _Use `$elemMatch` and `$gte` on `startTime`._

4. **Find all `car` or `truck` type vehicles**
   _Use `$in` on the `type` field._

---

### Optional Bonus Task:

Add a **custom instance method** to the Vehicle schema:

```js
vehicle.totalDistance();
```

## **Instructions**:

1. Ensure proper responses for all routes, including success messages and meaningful error messages.
2. Handle errors gracefully using appropriate status codes and error-handling middleware.
3. Segregate files and folders properly (e.g., `models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `config/`).
4. Submit the assignment by pushing it to your Masai Repo and sharing the link.
