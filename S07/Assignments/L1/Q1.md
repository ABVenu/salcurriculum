# **L1: User Schema with Nested Profile Management**

---

**Objective**: Create a User schema with an array of nested profile data using Mongoose. Implement validations on schema fields and add routes to create users, add profiles, and retrieve all users. This assignment will help you understand working with nested schemas and CRUD operations in Mongoose.

## **L0: User Schema Creation and Profile Management**

1. **User Schema with Nested Profiles**:

   - Define a `User` schema with the following fields:
     - `name`: String, required
     - `email`: String, required, must be unique
     - `password`: String, required, with a minimum length of 6
     - `profiles`: Array of nested schema objects
   - The nested `profile` schema should contain:
     - `profileName`: Enum with values `["fb", "twitter", "github", "instagram"]`, required
     - `url`: String, required, must be a valid URL format
   - Ensure appropriate schema-level validations for each field.

2. **Route 1: Add User**:

   - Create a POST route (`/add-user`) to add a new user with basic details (name, email, and password).
   - Ensure that no duplicate emails are allowed.

3. **Route 2: Add Profiles to an Existing User**:

   - Create a POST route (`/add-profile/:userId`) to add new profiles to a user.
   - Validate that the `profileName` is one of the allowed enum values and that the `url` is provided.

4. **Route 3: Get All Users**:
   - Create a GET route (`/get-users`) to retrieve all users and their profiles.
   - Allow filtering users based on profile name (e.g., retrieve users with `github` profiles).

## **Instructions**:

1. Ensure proper responses for all routes, including success messages and meaningful error messages.
2. Handle errors gracefully using appropriate status codes and error-handling middleware.
3. Segregate files and folders properly (e.g., `models/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `config/`).
4. Submit the assignment by pushing it to your Masai Repo and sharing the link.
