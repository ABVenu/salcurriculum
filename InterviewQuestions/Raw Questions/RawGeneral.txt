  - Bob Jones lives with his family. His family has N members with member IDs 0 to N-1. Bob Jones is the head of the family with member ID 0. His family has K number of earning members. Every month, each earning member receives their salary in a particular order and then gives it to their parent; the parent in turn gives the salary to their parents, and so on. The salary will be given to the highest member of the family hierarchy. If member A is the parent of member B and if A has already received the salary, then B will keep the salary. For example, in the given family hierarchy A > B > C, B is the parent of A and C is the parent of B, so if A receives the salary, then it first goes to B, and then it goes to C but in case if C already had received the salary then B will keep the salary of A and if in case B also received the salary already then, A will keep the salary. You are given two integers, N and K, where N is the total number of members in the family, and K is the total number of earning members in the family. You are given an array parents representing the parent's member ID, where the index represents the child's member ID. As Bob Jones is the head of the family, he will have no parent that will be represented by -1, and therefore, the parent array will always start with -1. You are given an array salary_order representing the member IDs of all the earning members of the family in the order they receive the salary that is index 0 receives the salary first and then index 1 and so on. Return an array containing the member ID of all members that keep the salary in the order they receive it.
