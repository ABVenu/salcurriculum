1. **Which of the following best describes the working of the Node.js event loop?**  
   a) It runs continuously and processes pending tasks from the event queue  
   b) It creates a new thread for each incoming request  
   c) It blocks execution while waiting for I/O operations to complete  
   d) It executes only synchronous operations  

   **Answer:** a) It runs continuously and processes pending tasks from the event queue  

2. **Why is Node.js suitable for handling I/O-heavy applications?**  
   a) It uses a multi-threaded synchronous approach  
   b) It processes requests in parallel using multiple cores  
   c) It uses an asynchronous, non-blocking event-driven architecture  
   d) It waits for each request to complete before handling the next one  

   **Answer:** c) It uses an asynchronous, non-blocking event-driven architecture  

3. **Which of the following is an example of an asynchronous operation in Node.js?**  
   a) Reading a large file   
   b) Setting a timer using `setTimeout`  
   c) Making an HTTP request
