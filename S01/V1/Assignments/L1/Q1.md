### **LO: File Handling in Node.js Using the `fs` Module**  

#### **Objective:**  
Create a **Node.js program** that performs file operations using the **`fs` module**. The program will:  
1. Read data from a file (`data.txt`).  
2. Append new content to the same file.  

---

### **Problem Statement:**  

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project**.  
2. **Create a file named `fileOperations.js`**, which will contain functions for file handling.  
3. **Create a file named `data.txt`** and add some initial text (e.g., `"This is the original content."`).  
4. **Implement the following functions in `fileOperations.js`**:  

   - `readFileData()` → Reads the content of `data.txt` and logs it to the console.  
   - `appendFileData()` → Appends `"This is Appended data"` to `data.txt`.  

5. **Export these functions from `fileOperations.js`**.  
6. **Create an `index.js` file**, which:  
   - Imports the functions from `fileOperations.js`.  
   - Calls `readFileData()` to display the initial content of `data.txt`.  
   - Calls `appendFileData()` to add `"This is Appended data"` to the file.  
   - Calls `readFileData()` again to confirm that the new content has been appended.  
7. **Run the program using Node.js**:  
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

---

### **Expected Output Example:**  
If implemented correctly, running `node index.js` should produce output like:  

```
Initial File Content:  
This is the original content.  

Appending data...  

Updated File Content:  
This is the original content.  
This is Appended data  
```

---

### **Other Instructions:**  
- The functions should **properly handle edge cases**, such as:  
  - If `data.txt` does not exist, create it dynamically.  
  - If `data.txt` is empty, handle it gracefully.  
  - Ensure that **file read and write operations** are performed asynchronously for better performance.  
- Maintain **clean and modular code**.
