### **LO: Implementing a Factorial Calculator Using Modules in Node.js**  

#### **Objective:**  
Create a **Node.js program** where a function to calculate the factorial of a given number is implemented in a separate file and then imported into `index.js` for execution with different values.  

---

#### **Problem Statement:**  

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project**.  
2. **Create a file named `factorial.js`** that contains a function to compute the factorial of a given number.  
3. **Export the function from `factorial.js`** so it can be used in another file.  
4. **Create an `index.js` file** that:  
   - Imports the `factorial` function from `factorial.js`.  
   - Calls the function with different values (e.g., `5, 7, 10`) and logs the results.  
5. **Run the program using Node.js**:  
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

---

#### **Expected Output Example:**  
If implemented correctly, running `node index.js` should produce output like:  

```
Factorial of 5 is: 120  
Factorial of 7 is: 5040  
Factorial of 10 is: 3628800  
```

---

### **Other Instructions:**  
- The function should **properly handle edge cases**, such as:  
  - If `n` is **less than 0**, return an appropriate message since factorial is not defined for negative numbers.  
  - If `n` is **0**, return `1` (as `0! = 1`).  
  - If `n` is **not a number**, handle the error gracefully.  
  - Ensure efficiency (use an optimized approach instead of recursion if `n` is large).  
- Maintain **clean and modular code**.

### **Submission Guidelines:**  
- Submit a **Masai gitHub repo link** after completion.
