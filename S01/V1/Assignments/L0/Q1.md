### **LO: Implementing a Prime Number Checker Using Modules in Node.js**

#### **Objective:**

Create a **Node.js program** where a function to check if a number is prime is implemented in a separate file and then imported into `index.js` for execution with different numbers.

---

#### **Problem Statement:**

1. **Initialize a new Node.js project**.
2. **Create a file named `isPrime.js`** that contains a function to check whether a number is prime.
3. **Export the function from `isPrime.js`** so it can be used in another file.
4. **Create an `index.js` file** that:
   - Imports the `isPrime` function from `isPrime.js`.
   - Calls the function with different numbers (e.g., `2, 10, 17, 21, 29`) and logs whether each is prime or not.
5. **Run the program using Node.js**:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

---

#### **Expected Output Example:**

If implemented correctly, running `node index.js` should produce output like:

```
2 is a prime number.
10 is not a prime number.
17 is a prime number.
21 is not a prime number.
29 is a prime number.
```

---

### **Other Instructions:**

- The function should **properly handle edge cases**, such as:
  - Checking numbers **less than 2** (should return "Not a prime number").
  - Handling **non-numeric inputs** gracefully.
  - Ensuring efficiency (avoid unnecessary calculations).
- Maintain **clean and modular code**.
