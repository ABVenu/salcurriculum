### **L2: Combining Built-in Modules and Custom Modules in Node.js**  

#### **Objective:**  
Practice using the **`crypto` module** to generate a random integer and create **custom modules** to perform operations such as checking if a number is even or odd, and calculating squares and cubes of numbers.  

---

### **Problem Statement:**  

1. **Create a new Node.js project**

2. **Create a file named `checkEvenOdd.js`** that contains two functions:  
   - `checkEven(num)`: Returns `true` if the number is even, otherwise `false`.  
   - `checkOdd(num)`: Returns `true` if the number is odd, otherwise `false`.  
   - Export both functions.  

3. **Create a file named `genSquareCube.js`** that contains two functions:  
   - `generateSquare(num)`: Returns the square of the number.  
   - `generateCube(num)`: Returns the cube of the number.  
   - Export both functions.  

4. **Create a file named `index.js`** that:  
   - Uses the **`crypto` module** to generate a **random integer between 1 and 100**.  
   - Imports `checkEven` and `checkOdd` from `checkEvenOdd.js`.  
   - Imports `generateSquare` and `generateCube` from `genSquareCube.js`.  
   - Checks if the generated number is even or odd:  
     - If **even**, prints the **cube** of the number.  
     - If **odd**, prints the **square** of the number.  
   - Prints the result in the following format:  

     ```
     Generated Number: 24
     The number is even, so its cube is: 13824
     ```

     ```
     Generated Number: 15
     The number is odd, so its square is: 225
     ```

5. **Run the program using Node.js**:  
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

### **Expected Output Example:**  

```
Generated Number: 42
The number is even, so its cube is: 74088
```

or  

```
Generated Number: 17
The number is odd, so its square is: 289
```

### **Other Instructions:**  
- Use proper module exporting and importing (`module.exports` and `require`).  
- Write clean and structured code.
