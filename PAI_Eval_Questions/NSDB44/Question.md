### **Problem Statement: Mini Banking System**

You are developing a **Mini Banking System** that allows users to manage their bank accounts using the command line. The system will be built using **TypeScript** and designed using **Object-Oriented Programming principles** along with relevant **design patterns**.

---

### **Requirements**

#### 1. **Core Functionality**
- Users can create a bank account by providing:
  - Name
  - Mobile number
- Each new account should:
  - Start with ‚Çπ2000 balance
  - Be assigned a unique Account Number and 4-digit PIN
- After login, users can:
  - Check balance
  - Deposit money
  - Withdraw money
  - Transfer money to another user
  - View mini statement (last 5 transactions)

---

#### 2. **Design Considerations**
- Follow **OOPS principles** to design classes for users, accounts, and transactions.
- Use **Singleton Pattern** to ensure:
  - One central banking system instance
  - No two accounts with the same mobile number
- Use **Strategy Pattern** to support banking rules:
  - Max 5 transactions per day
  - Max ‚Çπ5000 can be transferred per day
- Maintain session states (login, logout)
- Add validations for all operations (e.g., insufficient balance, transfer limits, duplicate mobile)

---

#### 3. **System Design Requirements**
- Build a **CLI application using TypeScript**
- Ensure the CLI is user-friendly with numbered menu choices
- Modular folder structure and clean code separation
- Provide class diagrams as part of system documentation

---
