## Assignment L0: Many-to-Many Schema – Student, Course & Enrollment

### **Goal**

Create a many-to-many relationship between Students and Courses using a **junction schema** named `Enrollment`.

---

### Schemas to Create

#### 1. **Student**

```js
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true }
}
```

#### 2. **Course**

```js
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true }
}
```

#### 3. **Enrollment** (Junction Schema)

```js
{
  studentId: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'Student' },
  courseId: { type: ObjectId, ref: 'Course' },
  enrolledAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  isActive: { type: Boolean, default: true }
}
```

---

### Tasks to Complete

1. **Student & Course APIs**

   - `POST /students` – Create a new student
   - `POST /courses` – Create a new course

2. **Enroll API**

   - `POST /enroll`
     → Body: `{ studentId, courseId }`
     → Only allow if both student and course are active

3. **Soft Delete**

   - `DELETE /students/:id`
     → Mark the student as `isActive: false`
     → Also mark related enrollments as `isActive: false`
   - `DELETE /courses/:id`
     → Mark the course as `isActive: false`
     → Also mark related enrollments as `isActive: false`

4. **List APIs**

   - `GET /students/:id/courses` → Return all active courses for the student
   - `GET /courses/:id/students` → Return all active students enrolled in the course

---

### Cascade Rule

> When a student or course is deleted (soft delete), all their enrollments must also be marked as inactive.

---

### Submission Instructions

- **Submit the GitHub Repository Link** via the Masai Assignment Portal.
- Ensure APIs are working using Postman or Thunder Client.

---

### Best Practices

- Maintain **clean folder structure**:

  ```
  |- models/
  |- routes/
  |- controllers/
  |- index.js
  ```

- Use `.env` for sensitive configs like DB URL.
- Use async/await and proper error handling.
- Add comments to explain logic where needed.
- Keep your code modular and readable.
