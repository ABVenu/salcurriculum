## Assignment L2: **Mentorship Platform – Mentors, Learners & Sessions**

### Problem Context

You are tasked with designing the backend data layer for a mentorship platform like "MentorHub," where industry professionals (Mentors) can offer learning Sessions, and Learners can book and attend these sessions. The platform needs to capture **many-to-many relationships** between Mentors and Learners through a **Session** entity that also tracks participation details and outcomes.

Your challenge is to **model the schema**, **design logic for key operations**, and **ensure data consistency** through appropriate strategies — especially focusing on cascading effects and inbuilt Mongoose query operators (no aggregation pipelines needed).

### Core Requirements

* A **Mentor** can conduct **multiple sessions**, and each session may be attended by **multiple learners**.
* A **Learner** can attend **multiple sessions** with one or more mentors.
* The **Session** entity acts as a **junction schema**, but also contains valuable metadata like session topic, time, notes, attendance, and feedback.

---

### Key Functional Expectations

1. **Design Relationships Intelligently**

   * Ensure schemas reflect real-world associations (many-to-many) and use references.
   * Consider using nested documents or reference arrays only where appropriate.

2. **Status Management**

   * Each entity must have an `isActive` or `status` flag to allow for **soft deletion** and **filtering only active data** in fetch queries.
   * If a **Mentor** or **Learner** is soft-deleted, all associated sessions must reflect the change appropriately — either by disabling the session or removing the learner from attendance.

3. **Operational Queries**
   Implement and test the following types of operations using **inbuilt query functions** only (`.find`, `.sort`, `.select`, `.countDocuments`, `.populate`, `.limit`, etc.):

   * Find all active sessions for a given mentor or learner.
   * Fetch recent sessions sorted by time, limited to 5.
   * Count the number of learners who attended a particular mentor’s sessions.
   * List all mentors a learner has ever interacted with.
   * List all learners for a particular session.
   * Fetch mentors who currently have no active sessions scheduled.
   * Identify learners who have attended more than 3 sessions.

4. **Cascading & Archiving Strategy**

   * Soft-deleting a **Mentor** should disable all their upcoming sessions.
   * Soft-deleting a **Learner** should remove them from all upcoming sessions or mark their attendance as "cancelled".
   * If a **Session** is deleted, it should not be permanently removed. Instead, implement an **archive mechanism**:

     * Move the session to a separate collection or
     * Add a `isArchived: true` field and exclude it from active queries.
       This is important for maintaining logs and post-analysis.

### Evaluation Criteria

* **Schema Design:** Efficiency and scalability of your models, use of references vs embedded docs.
* **Code Organization:** Use proper folder structure, controller-service separation, environment config, etc.
* **Query Logic:** Use of correct Mongoose operators for filtering, sorting, limiting, and referencing.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensure consistent behavior on deletion or updates (e.g., cascading inactivations, session archiving).
* **Error Handling:** Graceful responses for invalid IDs, missing references, and inactive states.
* **Code Cleanliness:** Naming conventions, reusable functions, and structured logic.

### Submission Guidelines

* Submit your GitHub repository link on the Masai Assignment Portal.
* Ensure your project is structured professionally (`models`, `routes`, `controllers`, etc.).
* Include a `README.md` explaining your schema design choices and cascading strategies.
* Optional: Provide a test script (`test.http` or Postman collection) to demonstrate your queries.
