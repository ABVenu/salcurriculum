# **L2: Blog Management API with Aggregation**

### **Objective:**

Build a Blog Management API where authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their blog posts. Additionally, implement an **aggregation route** to analyze blog data across users.

Passwords must be **hashed using `bcrypt` during signup**.
Use **JWT-based authentication** to protect routes.

---

### **Schema Details:**

#### **`users` Collection**

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true },
  password: String // Store hashed password
});
```

#### **`blogs` Collection**

```js
const blogSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  content: String,
  tags: [String],
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  createdBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
});
```

### **Routes & Access Control:**

#### **1️ Authentication Routes**

* **POST `/signup`** → Register a new user (hash the password).
* **POST `/login`** → Login and receive a JWT token.

#### **2️ Auth Middleware (`authMiddleware.js`)**

* Verifies JWT and attaches user info to `req.user`.

#### **3️ Blog Routes (Protected by JWT)**

* **POST `/blogs`** → Create a new blog (only for logged-in users).
* **GET `/blogs`** → Fetch all blogs created by the logged-in user.
* **PUT `/blogs/:id`** → Update a blog if it belongs to the logged-in user.
* **DELETE `/blogs/:id`** → Delete a blog if it belongs to the logged-in user.

#### **4️ Aggregation Route (Analytics)**

* **GET `/blogs/stats`** → Return analytics like:

  * Total number of blogs
  * Blog count per user
  * Most common tags across all blogs
    *(Uses MongoDB aggregation pipeline)*

---

### **Expected Outcomes:**

* Users can **sign up** and **log in** securely.
* Authenticated users can **manage only their own blogs**.
* An analytics route summarizes **blog data using aggregation**.
* **Unauthorized users cannot access any route.**

1. Build using **Node.js + Express + Mongoose**.
2. Use `bcrypt` to **hash passwords** during signup.
3. Protect routes with **JWT authentication middleware**.
4. Implement a **MongoDB aggregation** route for blog analytics.
5. Push your project to the **Masai GitHub repository** for submission.
