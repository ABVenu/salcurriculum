# **L1: CRUD Operations API with Authentication**

### **Objective:**

Develop an API that allows users to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) notes**, but **only if they are logged in**.
✅ Passwords must be **hashed using `bcrypt` during signup** to ensure secure storage.

---

### **Schema Details:**

#### **`users` Collection**

```js
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: { type: String, unique: true },
  password: String // ✅ Store hashed password
});
```

#### **`notes` Collection**

```js
const noteSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  content: String,
  createdBy: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "User" }
});
```

---

### **Routes & Access Control:**

#### **1️ Authentication Routes**

* **POST `/signup`** → Hash the password using `bcrypt` and register a new user.
* **POST `/login`** → Authenticate the user by comparing hashed passwords and generate a **JWT token**.

#### **2️ Middleware for Authentication**

* **Auth Middleware (`authMiddleware.js`)** → Verifies JWT and attaches user info to `req.user`.

#### **3️ CRUD Operations on Notes (Protected by JWT)**

* **POST `/notes`** → **Create a new note** (only for logged-in users).
* **GET `/notes`** → **Fetch only the notes created by the logged-in user**.
* **PUT `/notes/:id`** → **Update only self-created notes**.
* **DELETE `/notes/:id`** → **Delete only self-created notes**.

---

### **Expected Outcomes:**

* **Only authenticated users can access the application.**
* **Users can only manage their own notes.**
* ✅ **Passwords are securely hashed during signup.**
* **Unauthorized users cannot access protected routes.**

## **Submission Instructions:**

1. **Create a Node.js + Express + Mongoose app** following best practices.
2. Use `bcrypt` to **hash passwords during signup** and compare them securely during login.
3. Implement **JWT-based authentication** and middleware to protect routes.
4. Ensure users can only manage their own data.
5. **Push your project to the Masai repository** for submission.
