**1. Why is bcrypt considered a secure choice for password hashing?**

A) It can reverse the hash when needed
B) It adds a salt automatically and allows configurable hashing rounds to slow down attackers
C) It stores passwords in plain text for easy retrieval
D) It uses less CPU, making it faster for real-time systems

**Answer:** B) It adds a salt automatically and allows configurable hashing rounds to slow down attackers

**2. Which of the following best describes how bcrypt handles password comparison?**

A) It decrypts the stored hash to check against the input password
B) It re-hashes the input password with the same salt and compares the result
C) It stores the plain password and directly compares it
D) It uses symmetric encryption to match both strings

**Answer:** B) It re-hashes the input password with the same salt and compares the result
