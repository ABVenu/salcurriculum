# **L1: Secure Authentication & Role-Based Access Control with a Service Booking System**  

### **Objective:**  
Build an authentication system with **signup, login, and role-based access control (RBAC)** using **JWT tokens**. Additionally, implement a **service booking system**, where users can book, manage, and cancel service appointments, while admins can manage all bookings.  

---

## **Problem Statement**  

You need to develop an authentication system that includes:  

### **1. User Authentication (Signup & Login)**  
- Users should be able to **sign up** with a **username, email, password**, and a default role of **"user"** (unless explicitly set as "admin").  
- The password must be **hashed** before storing it in the database.  
- On successful **login**, generate **JWT access & refresh tokens** with proper **expiration times**.  

### **2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- Users with the role **"user"** can **book, view, update, and cancel their own service appointments**.  
- Users with the role **"admin"** can **view, approve, reject, or delete any booking**.  
- JWT authentication should be used to secure these routes.  

### **3. Service Booking System (CRUD with Business Logic)**  
- Users can **create a booking** for a service (e.g., plumbing, car repair, cleaning).  
- Each booking should have:  
  - **Service Name**  
  - **Requested Date & Time**  
  - **Booking Status** (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `cancelled`)  
- Users can **update or cancel** only their own bookings before **approval**.  
- Admins can **approve or reject** any booking request.  

### **4. Token Expiration & Security Measures**  
- **Access Token Expiry:** **15 minutes**  
- **Refresh Token Expiry:** **7 days**  
- Implement a **refresh token mechanism** to issue a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.

## **API Requirements**  

### **Authentication Routes:**  
- **POST `/signup`** → Register a new user (**password should be hashed**)  
- **POST `/login`** → Authenticate user & generate JWT tokens  
- **POST `/refresh`** → Issue a new access token using a refresh token  

### **Service Booking Routes (Protected, Role-Based)**  
- **POST `/bookings`** → **Users** can create a new booking (**status = "pending"**)  
- **GET `/bookings`** → **Users** can view their own bookings, **Admins** can view all bookings  
- **PUT `/bookings/:id`** → **Users** can update their bookings **(only if pending)**  
- **DELETE `/bookings/:id`** → **Users** can cancel their own bookings **(only if pending)**  
- **PATCH `/bookings/:id/approve`** → **Admins** can approve a booking  
- **PATCH `/bookings/:id/reject`** → **Admins** can reject a booking  
- **DELETE `/bookings/:id`** → **Admins** can delete any booking  

---

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- Users should be able to **sign up and log in securely**  
- **Role-based authentication** should restrict access to admin-only routes  
- **CRUD operations** for service bookings should follow business rules  
- JWT tokens should be **properly implemented and secured**  
- **Refresh tokens** should allow users to extend sessions securely  

---

## **Submission Guidelines**  
- Implement **signup, login, role-based access, and service booking** features  
- Ensure **JWT authentication, refresh tokens, and error handling**  
- Follow **proper code structure** (segregate authentication, routes, models, and controllers)  
- Push your **code to the Masai repository** for submission
