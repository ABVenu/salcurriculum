## Content/Pedagagoy

### Scene 1.0:

#### 1.1 Demonstartion of Role Based Access Control

- Example of Masai LMS, students can create Lectures, Assignments??
- Why Student's can't create??, they are also users of Masai LMS right???
- Yes, they are Masai Users, but the role is different, the permitted operations of the Student Role is Attend Lecture, solve Assignments
- Admin Role Users can create Lectures/ Assignments etc
- Why RBAC: Enhances security by ensuring users can only access resources relevant to their role
- Simplifies permission management by assigning access based on roles, not individuals
- Scales and maintains easily, especially as the application and team grow

#### 1.2 Difference between Authentication & Authorization

- Authentication means, whether User is Associated/Registered with system??
- Authorization means, yes User is Associated/Registered with system, but at what Level?? what permissions are granted??

#### 1.3 Implementation of RBAC

- Making simple stratergies like adding role in User Profile
- While login, even Role is encrypted in token
- Modifying the Auth Middleware, once token verified, check the role as well,
- Allowed role is specified at Route Level,
- Auth Middleware should allow, if role of user in token and role specified at Route is matching

```javascript
const authorizeRoles = (...roles) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ msg: "Access Denied" });
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

#### 1.3 Token Expiry

- JWT provides an option to add expiry time while generating token,
- Token expiry helps in enhaching the security, that is after sometime user should login again to continue, which helps in prevention of false person using the systems
  - Best example is Mobile Banking Apps, Websites where once loggedIn, users are allowed for max 20 to 30 mins, and user should login again
- Asking to login again and again may lower the user experience, but not compromised with security
- Quicky Implement by adding `expiresIn` in jwt and demonstrate again

## Scene 2.0: Third-Party Authentication

### 2.1 Activity: Why Do We Need Third-Party Authentication?

Let's begin with a quick thought experiment:

- How many websites or online services does a person typically use in a day?
- Can they realistically remember unique login credentials for each one?
- Now imagine if, instead of creating new credentials for every platform, they could simply use the login they already use daily ‚Äî like Google or Facebook ‚Äî to access your system.

This leads us to a key usability and security concept: **Third-Party Authentication**.

---

#### Why Use Third-Party Authentication?

- **Better User Experience:**
  Users can log in using accounts they already trust and use frequently (Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.), saving time and reducing friction.

- **Reduced Responsibility:**
  Your system doesn't have to store, manage, or secure passwords ‚Äî lowering the risk of breaches and simplifying your backend logic.

- **Built-in Security:**
  These third-party providers offer mature, well-tested authentication systems with security features like OAuth, 2FA, session control, and login alerts.

---

#### What Is Third-Party Authentication?

- Instead of building and managing your own login system, you integrate **authentication APIs** provided by major platforms like:

  - **Google**
  - **Facebook**
  - **GitHub**
  - **Twitter**, and others

- These companies act as **Identity Providers**.

  - Your system redirects the user to the provider.
  - The provider authenticates the user.
  - Upon success, the provider sends your system a token (usually via **OAuth** or **OpenID Connect**) confirming the user's identity.
  - You then allow access based on that confirmation.

#### 2.2 How Third Party Auth's works

- **User clicks "Login with \[Provider]"** (e.g., GitHub, Google) and is redirected to the third-party authentication page.
- **The auth provider renders its own UI** for login; the user enters credentials, which are **verified by the provider using its own database**.
- If valid, the provider **generates a token and shares minimal profile info** (like name, email) with your app.
- **User is redirected back to your app**, typically to a predefined callback route.
- Your app may **either use the third-party access token** for further API calls or **generate its own token (e.g., JWT)** for local session handling.
- **User is now considered authenticated** in your system and can access protected routes.

#### 2.3 Implementation of Github OAuth using passportjs

- Why Github??, easy to implement comnapred to others
- Document Ref Link `https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-github/`
- Get client ID and client secret from Github Developer Account
- We will just use Profile Information, Our Access Token will be used for all Protected Routes

### **Scene 3.0 ‚Äì Access Token & Refresh Token**

---

#### **3.1 Activity: Why Do We Need Refresh Tokens?**

- Imagine you log into your **Mobile Banking App**, and the **login session expires every 5 minutes**.
  ‚û§ Would you be okay **logging in again and again** every few minutes just to continue banking?

- Now imagine if the **login token never expires** after logging in once.
  ‚û§ Would it be safe to remain permanently logged in, even if someone else gets access to your device?

‚û°Ô∏è **Both options are flawed** ‚Äî we need a **secure and user-friendly way** to keep users logged in without compromising safety.

---

#### **3.2 Working Principle of Access & Refresh Tokens**

- To solve this, we use **two tokens**:

  - üîê **Access Token**:
    Short-lived (e.g., 10 minutes), used to access protected routes.

  - üîÅ **Refresh Token**:
    Long-lived (e.g., 40 minutes), used to request a new Access Token when it expires.

---

#### **How the Flow Works (Example: Net Banking Site)**

- Upon successful login, the user receives:

  - an **Access Token** (valid for 10 minutes)
  - a **Refresh Token** (valid for 40 minutes)

- While using the site:

  - At the **10-minute mark**, the **Access Token expires**.
  - The browser/app **automatically uses the Refresh Token** to request a new Access Token ‚Äî all behind the scenes.
  - This **silent renewal** continues smoothly until the **40-minute mark**.

- At the **41st minute**, the Refresh Token also expires.
  ‚û§ The user is prompted to **log in again** for security.

#### **3.3: Implementation of Access Token - Refresh Token**

- If time permits, this will be implemented or session conludes at 3.2
