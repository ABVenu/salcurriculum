### **L1: Build a Ticketing System – Handle & Resolve Issues**  

#### **Objective:**  
Develop a **Ticketing System** using **Express.js**, where users can create, update, view, and delete support tickets. Additionally, users should be able to **resolve tickets**, and a **middleware** should validate incoming ticket data.  

#### **Problem Statement:**  

Your company is rolling out a **basic Ticketing System** for internal issue tracking. You have been assigned to build the backend using **Express.js**. The app should:  

1. **Store tickets in `db.json`** (as a simple database).  
2. **Support full CRUD operations** on tickets.  
3. **Enforce ticket validation** when creating a ticket using a middleware.  
4. **Ensure a default status (`pending`)** for all new tickets.  
5. **Provide an additional endpoint** to **resolve a ticket** (update status from `pending` to `resolved`).  

#### **Project Structure:**  
Follow the **MVC architecture**:  
- `models/` → Handles data reading/writing from `db.json`.  
- `controllers/` → Implements logic for ticket operations.  
- `routes/` → Defines API endpoints for handling tickets.  
- `middlewares/` → Contains `dataCheckMiddleware.js` for request validation.  

#### **Ticket Features & Endpoints:**  
- `GET /tickets` → Fetch all tickets.  
- `GET /tickets/:id` → Fetch a ticket by ID.  
- `POST /tickets` → Create a new ticket.  
  - **Middleware** should check if all required fields (`title`, `description`, `priority`, `user`) are present.  
  - Default status should be `"pending"`.  
- `PUT /tickets/:id` → Update a ticket (title, description, priority).  
- `DELETE /tickets/:id` → Delete a ticket.  
- `PATCH /tickets/:id/resolve` → Change status of a ticket from **"pending"** to **"resolved"**.  

#### **Middleware: `dataCheckMiddleware.js`**  
- Ensures all **required fields** (`title`, `description`, `priority`, `user`) are present in the request body.  
- If any field is missing, responds with `{ "error": "Data insufficient, please provide all required fields" }`.  

#### **Expected Output Examples:**  

- `POST /tickets` with `{ "title": "Login Issue", "description": "Unable to login", "priority": "high", "user": "John Doe" }`  
  → Successfully creates a ticket with default status `"pending"`.  

- `POST /tickets` with `{ "title": "Bug Report", "priority": "medium" }`  
  → Returns `{ "error": "Data insufficient, please provide all required fields" }`.  

- `PATCH /tickets/1/resolve`  
  → Updates **ticket ID 1** status to `"resolved"`.  

- `GET /tickets/1` → Returns details of **ticket ID 1**.  

- Visiting an undefined route → **"404 Not Found"**.  

### **Other Instructions**  
- Use **Express Router** to structure routes properly.  
- Maintain **modular and reusable code**.  
- Ensure **error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes**.  

### **Submission Guidelines**  
- Push your code to a **Masai GitHub repository**.  
- Include a **README** with setup instructions.
