### **L1: Powering an E-Commerce Store – Build a Product Management System**  

#### **Objective:**  
Develop a **Product Management System** using **Express.js**, ensuring structured data storage, request validation, and activity logging while incorporating essential product-related features beyond just CRUD operations.  

#### **Story:**  

You have joined an **e-commerce startup** as a backend developer. The company is expanding its catalog, and the team needs a well-structured backend API to manage products effectively.  

During a strategy meeting, the **Product Manager** outlines the core requirements:  

> *"We need a backend system where products can be added, updated, and removed, but we also need additional functionalities to help customers and our inventory team. Users should be able to search for products, filter them based on price, and update stock levels. Also, instead of deleting products permanently, we should have a way to mark them as unavailable without losing data."*  

The **Tech Lead** adds:  

> *"Our API should be properly structured using Express Router, and we need middleware for validation. We also want to log every request to help us monitor the system in real-time. If any required product information is missing, we should reject the request before it even reaches the controller."*  

You take on the challenge and decide to **structure your work into three main tasks**:  

### **Task 1: Implement Core Product Management (CRUD Operations)**  
- Products should be stored in a **simple JSON database** (`db.json`).  
- Every product entry must have the following essential details:  
  - `name` (e.g., "iPhone 15")  
  - `description` (brief details about the product)  
  - `price` (numeric value representing cost)  
  - `category` (e.g., "Electronics", "Fashion")  
  - `stock` (quantity available for purchase)  
  - `imageURL` (a valid URL to the product’s image)  
- Users should be able to:  
  - **Create** a new product.  
  - **Retrieve** all products or a single product by ID.  
  - **Update** product details.  
  - **Soft delete** a product by marking it as `"deleted": true"`.  

### **Task 2: Additional Essential Features Beyond CRUD**  
Apart from standard CRUD operations, implement the following essential functionalities:  

#### **Search Products by Name or Category**  
- Users should be able to search for products using keywords.  
- Example: Searching for `"iphone"` should return all iPhone products.  
- Example endpoint: `/products/search?q=iphone`  

#### **Filter Products by Price Range**  
- Customers should be able to filter products within a specific price range.  
- Example: `/products/filter?min=500&max=2000` should return products priced between **$500** and **$2000**.  

#### **Update Stock Levels**  
- Inventory managers should be able to update product stock.  
- Example endpoint: `/products/:id/stock` (updates stock quantity).  

#### **Soft Delete Products Instead of Permanent Deletion**  
- Instead of deleting products permanently, implement a **soft delete** mechanism where products are marked as unavailable (`"deleted": true`).  
- Deleted products should not appear in the normal product listing but should still exist in the database for future reference.  

#### **Get All Available Products (Excluding Deleted Ones)**  
- The default product listing should **exclude** soft-deleted products.  

### **Task 3: Implement Middleware for Validation & Logging**  
To ensure data consistency and monitor API activity, implement the following middleware:  

#### **1. Data Validation Middleware (`dataCheckMiddleware.js`)**  
- This middleware should verify that all required fields are present when adding a product.  
- If any required field is missing, the request should be rejected with:  

```json
{ "error": "Missing required fields" }
```

- **Validation Rules:**  
  - `name`, `description`, `category`, and `imageURL` should be **non-empty strings**.  
  - `price` should be a **number greater than zero**.  
  - `stock` should be a **positive integer**.  
  - `imageURL` should be in a **valid URL format**.  

#### **2️⃣ Logger Middleware (`loggerMiddleware.js`)**  
- Logs every request to track API activity.  
- Log format:  

```
[2025-03-24 14:30:00] POST /products
[2025-03-24 14:31:15] GET /products
[2025-03-24 14:33:42] PATCH /products/2/stock
```

- Logs should include:  
  - **Request method** (e.g., `POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).  
  - **Requested endpoint** (e.g., `/products`, `/products/:id`).  
  - **Timestamp** of the request.  

### **Your Approach**  
- **Follow MVC architecture**:  
  - Create separate **models, controllers, and routes** for managing products.  
  - Implement **Express Router** for better code organization.  
- **Ensure error handling** for invalid inputs and missing resources.  
- **Use appropriate HTTP status codes** for different responses.  

### **Challenges & Considerations**  
- How will you structure the **soft delete functionality** so it doesn't affect the product listing?  
- How will you efficiently implement **search and filter operations**?  
- How can you prevent **duplicate product entries**?  
- How will you design the **stock update mechanism**?  

This project is a **real-world simulation** of an e-commerce backend, requiring thoughtful implementation of product-related features.  

### **Submission Guidelines**  
- Push your code to a **Masai GitHub repository**.  
- Include a **README** with setup instructions.
