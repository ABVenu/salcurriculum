### **L0: Build a Todo Application – A Developer’s Request**  

#### **Objective:**  
Design and implement a structured **Todo App** using **Express.js**, handling CRUD operations efficiently while supporting **partial search**.  

#### **Problem Statement:**  

You have recently joined a small development team that maintains a simple **Todo Management System**. The team lead has assigned you a task:  

*"We need a well-structured Express.js app for managing todos. Right now, we're using a simple JSON file (`db.json`) as our database. The app should allow users to add, update, read, and delete todos, ensure updation and deletion done through params. Also, searching should be smart enough to return results even if users enter partial words from the todo title through query."*  

You decide to **break down** the task into the following steps:  

1. **Project Initialization:**  
   - Set up a **Node.js** project and install **Express.js**.  
   - Use `db.json` as a simple database to store todos.  

2. **Project Structure:**  
   - Follow the **MVC architecture**:  
     - `models/` → Handles data structure & reading/writing to `db.json`.  
     - `controllers/` → Implements business logic for CRUD operations.  
     - `routes/` → Defines API endpoints for handling todos.  

4. **Extra Features:**  
   - Handle **errors gracefully**.  
   - Ensure code is **modular and reusable**.  
   - Undefined routes should return a **404 Not Found** response.  

#### **Expected Output Examples:**  

- `GET /todos` → Returns all todos stored in `db.json`.  
- `POST /todos` with `{ "title": "Buy groceries", "completed": false }` → Adds a new todo.  
- `GET /todos/search?q=gro` → Returns any todo with "gro" in its title (e.g., **"Buy groceries"**).  
- `PUT /todos/1` with `{ "completed": true }` → Updates the completion status of **todo ID 1**.  
- `DELETE /todos/2` → Deletes the todo with **ID 2**.  
- Visiting an undefined route → **"404 Not Found"**.  

### **Other Instructions**  
- Follow **MVC principles** to structure your code.  
- Ensure **efficient file handling** for `db.json`.  
- Implement **case-insensitive partial search** for better search (**optional**).  

### **Submission Guidelines**  
- Push your code to a **Masai GitHub repository**.  
- Include a **README** with setup instructions.
