### **L2: Build a Book Management System with Admin & Reader Routes**  

#### **Objective:**  
Develop a **Book Management System** using **Express.js** that enables **admins** to manage books (CRUD) and **readers** to borrow and return books. Implement middleware for request logging, return validation, and transaction logging.  

---

## **Problem Statement**  
You have been hired as a **backend developer** for a **digital library**. The library allows **admins** to manage book inventory and **readers** to borrow and return books.  

In the first meeting, the **Library Manager** explains:  
> *"Our digital library should allow admins to add, update, and remove books. Readers should be able to browse available books, borrow a book, and return it when they are done. However, once a book is borrowed, it should not be available to other readers until it is returned."*  

The **Tech Lead** adds:  
> *"We need to track who borrowed the book and when. Also, to prevent misuse, books cannot be returned within three days of borrowing. We should also have middleware that logs all transactions whenever a book is borrowed or returned."*  

To build this system, you will **split the routes into two sections**:  

### ** Task 1: Admin Routes for Managing Books**  
- **Admin can perform full CRUD operations on books.**  
- Each book should have:  
  - `id` (Unique identifier)  
  - `title` (Name of the book)  
  - `author` (Book's author)  
  - `genre` (e.g., Fiction, Science, Mystery)  
  - `publishedYear` (Year the book was published)  
  - `status` (either `"available"` or `"borrowed"`)  
- Books will be stored in `db.json`.  

**Admin Routes:**  
- `POST /admin/books` â†’ Add a new book.  
- `GET /admin/books` â†’ Get all books (both available and borrowed).  
- `PATCH /admin/books/:id` â†’ Update book details.  
- `DELETE /admin/books/:id` â†’ Remove a book.  

---

### ** Task 2: Reader Routes for Borrowing & Returning Books**  
**Reader Routes:**  
- `GET /reader/books` â†’ Fetch **only available** books.  
- `POST /reader/borrow/:id` â†’ Borrow a book.  
- `POST /reader/return/:id` â†’ Return a book.  

#### **Borrowing a Book (`POST /reader/borrow/:id`)**  
- A reader can borrow a book only if it's **available**.  
- The request must include the **readerâ€™s name**.  
- When a book is borrowed:  
  - The bookâ€™s `status` changes from `"available"` â†’ `"borrowed"`.  
  - The `borrowedBy` field is updated with the **readerâ€™s name**.  
  - The `borrowedDate` is set to the **current date**.  
- Example request:  
  ```json
  {
    "readerName": "John Doe"
  }
  ```
- Example book entry after borrowing:  
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "The Great Gatsby",
    "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    "genre": "Fiction",
    "publishedYear": 1925,
    "status": "borrowed",
    "borrowedBy": "John Doe",
    "borrowedDate": "2025-03-24"
  }
  ```

#### **Returning a Book (`POST /reader/return/:id`)**  
- A book can only be returned if **at least 3 days** have passed since it was borrowed.  
- If attempted before 3 days, the request should be rejected with:  
  ```json
  { "error": "Book cannot be returned within 3 days of borrowing." }
  ```
- When a book is returned:  
  - The bookâ€™s `status` changes back to `"available"`.  
  - The `borrowedBy` and `borrowedDate` fields are **cleared**.  

---

### ** Task 3: Middleware Implementation**  

**Logger Middleware (`loggerMiddleware.js`)**  
- Logs **every request** (method, route, and timestamp).  
- Example logs:  
  ```
  [2025-03-24 10:00:00] POST /admin/books
  [2025-03-24 10:05:10] GET /reader/books
  [2025-03-24 10:10:30] POST /reader/borrow/3
  ```

**Return Check Middleware (`returnCheckMiddleware.js`)**  
- Ensures that a **book cannot be returned within 3 days** of borrowing.  
- If a user tries to return a book early, respond with:  
  ```json
  { "error": "Book cannot be returned within 3 days of borrowing." }
  ```

**Borrow & Return Transaction Logger (`transactionLogger.js`)**  
- Logs whenever a book is **borrowed or returned**.  
- Example log:  
  ```
  [2025-03-24 11:00:00] John Doe borrowed "The Great Gatsby"
  [2025-03-27 14:15:20] John Doe returned "The Great Gatsby"
  ```

### ** Challenges & Considerations**  
- How will you **handle cases where a book ID does not exist**?  
- How will you ensure that **only available books can be borrowed**?  
- What strategy will you use to **store and retrieve borrowed book details efficiently**?  
- How will you **restrict books from being returned too early**?  

---

### ** Your Approach**  
- **Follow MVC architecture**:  
  - Separate **models, controllers, and routes**.  
  - Use **Express Router** for better code organization.  
- **Implement proper error handling** for missing resources and invalid inputs.  
- **Use appropriate HTTP status codes** for responses.  

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Submission Guidelines**  
- Push your code to a **Masai GitHub repository**.  
- Include a **README** with setup instructions.

This project is a **real-world simulation** of a book management system, requiring careful implementation of **admin operations, borrowing logic, return validation, and logging mechanisms**. ðŸš€
