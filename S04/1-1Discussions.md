### **Key Points of the session and expected LOs Discussed**
- session 3 ends with express router

- Session 04: Introduction to Middlewares
- In the previous day code, Insert some unaccepted data, like title is "", instructor Name is "", where lecture is inserted in db.json with blank lecture title, instructor name etc, which helps to understand need of something called as "Middleware's", which is apart from Business Logic
  - *Pain Point: Direct Middleware introductions will not get them feel of need & importance of middlewares*
- Then introducing middleware,
- Types of middleware's  (Suggested is, for S04 simple custom middleware and inbuilt Mw)
- Implementing the types of middleware, clearly explaining the location of application of Middleware (application level or Router level), make them comfortable and confident in deciding the location of middleware application
    - *Pain Point:  first of middleware itself is confusing that how it is working, then types of middlewares make still confusing on that location of application of middlewares*
Generally what I have observed is students needed minimum 3 to 4 days digest middleware
- So Venu's suggestion is External Middleware's should be taken in next session
